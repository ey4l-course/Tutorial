# ADR-002: Split Admin Console into Separate React App

**Status:** Proposed  
**Date:** 2025-08-28  

## Context
The UI has 3 domains: auth (login/register), user console, and admin console.  
We must ensure regular users cannot see or download any admin-related code or routes.

## Decision
Use **three React apps**:  
- `auth-ui`: `/login`, `/register`  
- `user-ui`: `/app/*` (user domain)  
- `admin-ui`: `/admin/*` (admin domain)  

Each build is isolated and deployed separately. Backend and reverse-proxy rules enforce access by role.

## Consequences
- No admin code leaks into user bundles.  
- Clear security separation and simpler CDN/edge controls.  
- Slightly more build/deploy complexity (3 artifacts instead of 2).
