# ADR-005: Implement Custom Access Denied Handling

## Context
During testing of the `/admin` endpoint, it was observed that 403 (Forbidden) responses triggered by Spring Security were not logged in `RequestContextDTO`.  
This occurred because the access denial was handled internally by Spring and never set an outcome in the request context.

## Decision
Implement a `CustomAccessDeniedHandler` that retrieves the `RequestContextDTO` from the request and sets the outcome to:

`[REJECTED] status: 403, {Exception message}`

The actual logging remains centralized in the `JwtAuthenticationFilter`’s `finally` block.

## Consequences
- All 403 responses will now appear in logs with consistent `[REJECTED]` messages.
- No duplicate logging logic — still handled in one place.
- Maintains uniform error message style by reusing `e.getMessage()`.
