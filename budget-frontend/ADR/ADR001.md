# ADR-001: Separate Auth Pages from Main App

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-08-28  

## Context  
We need register and login pages for unauthenticated users.  
The main SPA should only be accessible after successful authentication.  

## Decision  
- Create two standalone React pages: `/login` and `/register`.  
- These pages are not bundled with the main SPA.  
- After successful login or registration, backend sets auth cookies and redirects to `/app/`.  
- The SPA (`/app/*`) loads only for authenticated users.  

## Consequences  
- Keeps app structure hidden from unauth users.  
- Smaller, faster load for public pages.  
- Requires separate build/deploy paths for auth pages and SPA.
